# Module 9 - Overview 

## Introduction 

- Graphs are similar to trees in that both data structures comprise of connected nodes. However, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles. I.e., we can have the following connected nodes: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1`. 

-  Two simple ways are breadth-first search and depth-first search. Breadth-first search looks at every adjacent node, then looks at all of their adjacent nodes, and so on. Depth-first search starts at a node, travels to the furthest possible node, then traces back to search other paths.

- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a way of finding the shortest path from one node to another when the connections between them have different weights. 

## Module Learning Outcomes

1. Describe the parts of a graph.

What does a node contain?

What does an edge contain?

2. Evaluate when it is appropriate to use a weighted graph vs. an unweighted graph.

What is an advantage to using an unweighted graph?

What are the characteristics of a data set that requires a weighted graph?
