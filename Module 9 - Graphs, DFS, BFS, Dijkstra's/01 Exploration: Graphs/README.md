# Graphs

## Introduction

- Graphs are ubiquitous in computer science:

Social networks, like Facebook or Twitter
Computer graphics
Machine learning
Computer vision
Logistics and optimization
Computer networking

- Graphs are made up of vertices, representing elements in the graph, and edges, representing the connections between those elements. 

## Graph Components

- Vertices represent objects, states (i.e. conditions or configurations), locations, etc. 

- Edges represent relationships or connections between vertices.

  - Edges are represented as vertex pairs: the set of edges $E = \{(v_i, v_j),...\}$. 
  
  - Edges can be directed or undirected. 

  - If there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_j$, then $v_i$ and $v_j$ are said to be adjacent (or they are neighbors).
  
  - Edges can be weighted or unweighted. (Weighted edges represent a property of the edge. For example, it might represent the distance between vertices).
