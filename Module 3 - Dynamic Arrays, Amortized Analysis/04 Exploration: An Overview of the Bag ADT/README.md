# Bag ADT

- In bag, the order of insertion is completely irrelevant. (Elements can be inserted and removed entirely at random.)

- In the stack and the queue abstractions, the order that elements are placed into the container is important. 


## The Bag ADT

## Required Functionality

- `add()` amortized $\mathcal{O}(1)$ 

- `remove()` $\mathcal{O}(n)$ 

- `count(item)()` $\mathcal{O}(n)$ 

- `clear()` $\mathcal{O}(1)$
