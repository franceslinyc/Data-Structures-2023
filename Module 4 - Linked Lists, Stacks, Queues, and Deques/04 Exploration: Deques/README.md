# Deques

Support

- add front, add back 

- remove front, remove back

## Deque Operations

- `add_front(x)` / `add_back(x)` 

- `remove_front() / remove_back()` 


### Implementing a Deque Using a Linked List

- To add an element to the front of a linked list-based deque like this one, we simply insert a new node after the front sentinel (but before the node immediately following the front sentinel).  

- To add an element to the back of such a deque, we simply have to insert a new node before the back sentinel (but again, after the node immediately prior to the back sentinel).

- Similarly, removing a value would entail removing the node directly after the front sentinel, and removing a value from the back would entail removing the node directly before the back sentinel.

- ......


### Why do we use sentinels like this (front and back sentinels) when implementing a deque on top of a linked list?

- eliminate the need to implement different functionality in the dequeâ€™s insertion operations, and different functionality in its removal operations.

- simplify implementation, factoring four operations down to just two methods: `add_node_before()` and `remove_node()`.
