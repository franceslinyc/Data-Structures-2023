# Exploration: Intro to Data Structures Notes

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs) vs Data Dtructures

- ADTs are data types modeled from the point of view of the user of that data type (e.g., a Python programmer using a dictionary).

  - For example, a hash table can be implemented with either a single list or a collection of lists. The user of the hash table doesn’t need to know (or care about) how it’s implemented, only how it behaves.
  
- Data structures are concrete representations of data, i.e., a data type from the point of view of the implementer. The user may not care how the hash table is implemented, but it might make a lot of difference to the developer of that hash table.

## Additional Notes

[Abstract data types vs Data structures](https://abrickshort.wordpress.com/2005/03/06/abstract-data-types-vs-data-structures/)

- ADT is the logical picture of the data and the operations to manipulate the component elements of the data. 

- Data structure is the actual representation of the data during the implementation and the algorithms to manipulate the data elements. 

- ADT is in the logical level and data structure is in the implementation level.
