# Rotation Mechanics

## Single Rotations


- To fix a left-left (L-L) imbalance at N, we apply a single right rotation around N.

- To fix a right-right (R-R) imbalance at N, we apply a single left rotation around N.


## Double Rotations

- To fix a left-right imbalance, we apply a left rotation around C followed by a right rotation around N.

- To fix a right-left imbalance, we apply a right rotation around C followed by a left rotation around N.
